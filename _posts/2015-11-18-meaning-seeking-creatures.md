"We humans appear to be meaning seeking creatures who have had the misfortune of being thrown into a world devoid of meaning. One of our major tasks is to invent a meaning sturdy enough to support a life and then to perform the tricky maneuver of denying our personal authorship of this meaning. Thus we conclude instead that it is 'out there' waiting for us. Our ongoing search for substantial meaning systems often throws us into crises of meaning."
