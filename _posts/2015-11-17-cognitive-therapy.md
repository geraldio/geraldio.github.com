To get a quick idea of what <span class="highlight">Cognitive Therapy</span> is, the daughter of founder, Aaron Beck, provides this quick summary:

"In a nutshell, the <i>cogntive model</i> proposes that distorted or <a href="/dysfunctional-thinking/" title="dysfunctional thinking">dysfunctional thinking</a>  (which influences the patient's mood and behavior) is common to all psychological disturbances. Realistic evaluation and modification of thinking produce an improvement in mood and behavior. Enduring improvement results from modification of the patient's underlying dysfunctional beliefs."<sup>1</sup>
